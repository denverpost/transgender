		<p class="lead">The children&rsquo;s names are scrawled on the wall of their bedroom in black marker, one on top of the next to mark how much they&rsquo;ve grown. Damien. Sky. Damien. Sky.</p>
		<p>And then at age 9, Damien is gone. Instead, in sparkling gold that stands out like a celebration, a proclamation with four exclamation points:</p>
		<p>Elsa.</p>
		<p>This is the name she chose, the little girl who was called a boy at birth but had been telling everyone as soon as she could speak that she was not. This is the normally peaceful child whose whole body, at age 2, tensed rigid and shuddered in shock when her mother said, &ldquo;You are a boy.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>This is the child, who at the carefree age of 3, while tossing a penny into a Denver fountain, said, &ldquo;I wish I was a girl.&rdquo; And then after glancing at her mother: &ldquo;I wish I was a boy. I wish I was a prince.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>That was six years ago.</p>
		<p>Now, she is Elsa, for the Disney princess of ice who guarded a dark secret but then &ldquo;let it go&rdquo; and found a way to live as her true self. Her family says she is &ldquo;truegender&rdquo; &mdash; not transgender &mdash; because she is living true to the gender she has identified with as early as her toddler days, when she refused to put on anything that wasn&rsquo;t beautiful. When she was teased for wearing headbands and hair pretties to preschool. When she played dress-up as a girl she called Ruby.</p>
		<p>It is who she has always been. It was not a transition.</p>

		<p>Elsa is growing up while transgender is having its moment. A civil rights battle is erupting alongside the eye-popping transition of Bruce Jenner to Caitlyn and a new comfort level in gender identity exploration played out in television shows like Transparent. This new awareness is resulting in a pioneering generation of children who are socially transitioning to their preferred gender at home and at school.</p>
		<p>Gender clinics for youths have opened in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles in the past few years, reporting instant and overwhelming numbers of patients whose families are bringing them at younger and younger ages. In Colorado, more than 120 children are seeking hormone blockers at Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Aurora to first &ldquo;pause puberty&rdquo; and, later, hormones to stimulate the puberty of the opposite sex.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It used to be the case that people would say, &lsquo;Something is wrong with my kid. I need to fix them,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Kristina Olson, a University of Washington psychology professor and director of the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/transyp/">TransYouth Project</a>. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s more, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect this.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
		<p>Elsa&rsquo;s parents tried for years to &ldquo;impose&rdquo; the male gender. There were forced haircuts and a rule of no dresses outside the house. They said it was a lie to dress like a girl and let people think she was one. &ldquo;You can be a boy who loves beautiful things, and that&rsquo;s a wonderful thing to be,&rdquo; her mother, Kai McKenzie, would say.</p>
		<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the thing.</p>
		<p>Elsa, her long, messy curls falling over her blue eyes, says now that it &ldquo;felt bad&rdquo; when people thought she was a boy. If she had to keep living that way, the 9-year-old said, &ldquo;I would have killed myself.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>By the time Elsa was 8, she was withdrawn, closing off, her personality fading. She struggled to learn at school, was breaking down whenever someone called her a boy. She asked her parents often why there was no one else like her. &ldquo;I wish I didn&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; she told them.</p>
		<p>The family rules weren&rsquo;t working. McKenzie and her husband, Steve, realized they needed help.</p>

		<p>It was up to Elsa, the counselor said, to decide who she was.</p>
		<p>Gender identity, a psychological sense of self as male or female, isn&rsquo;t something most people think about. It&rsquo;s just there, part of the inner voice. But for those who are transgender, an estimated three in 1,000 people according to <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Gates-How-Many-People-LGBT-Apr-2011.pdf">a 2011 University of California, Los Angeles study</a>, that inner voice is in conflict.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time we didn&rsquo;t call this anything. It was invisible,&rdquo; said Dr. Sarah Burgamy, a Denver clinical psychologist and gender specialist.</p>
		<p>When gender variance first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in the 1990s, it was labeled &ldquo;gender identity disorder.&rdquo; The latest version of the manual, in 2013, renamed it &ldquo;gender dysphoria,&rdquo; removing the stigma of a &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; but <a href="http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf">still recognizing mental health problems</a> caused when someone &ldquo;whose gender at birth is contrary to the one they identify with.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Among psychologists, there is a growing sense that gender dysphoria isn&rsquo;t an indication that &ldquo;something is wrong,&rdquo; just a &ldquo;variation on human identity,&rdquo; Burgamy said. Parents who seek her help always want answers to two questions: &ldquo;What caused it?&rdquo; And, &ldquo;Did I cause it?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Her answer to both: Gender identity is there from birth. It&rsquo;s just that society looks at only one part of the equation when assigning gender &mdash; what&rsquo;s between a person&rsquo;s legs. There is no scientific test for whether a person feels male or female.</p>
		<p>Among gender identity specialists, the growing sentiment is that counseling to push a child to conform to their assigned gender doesn&rsquo;t work, although some parents seek that type of treatment. Several experts interviewed by The Denver Post said parents should give children room to explore their gender identity without pushing them in a certain direction. If given space, they will discover what is innate.</p>
		<p>A few decades ago, common medical thought was that parents could &ldquo;socialize&rdquo; gender. The infamous &ldquo;John-Joan&rdquo; case of 1965, about a baby whose circumcision went horrifically wrong, is referenced as proof that raising a child as a certain gender cannot override gender identity.</p>
		<p>When a circumcision of one of two Canadian identical twins was botched, nearly burning off the infant&rsquo;s penis, doctors at Johns Hopkins recommended surgery to create female anatomy. The baby&rsquo;s parents were advised to raise him as female. The boy suffered a life of misery because he never felt like a girl, despite pretty dresses and injections of female hormones, and by age 13, was suicidal, according to a book about his life. He transitioned to a male at age 14 after learning what had happened to him.</p>
		<p>He later killed himself.</p>
		<p>The case wasn&rsquo;t widely known until the late 1990s and has since shaped how doctors advise parents of children born intersex, with genitalia not clearly male or female. About one in 2,000 infants are born intersex, including some who have an extra sex chromosome, beyond the typical XX or XY.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Things can happen or perhaps they just are,&rdquo; said Anna Wegleitner, a highly sought Denver family physician who saw her first transgender patient 23 years ago. She now has a waiting list months long and accepts only transgender patients, seeing two to three new ones per day. &ldquo;I tend to think it&rsquo;s part of the human experience. People want to know why because they want to be able to fix it.&rdquo;</p>

		<!-- <h3 class="subheading">&ldquo;Meant to be a girl&rdquo;</h3> -->

		<p class="lead">Week after week, for months, Elsa&rsquo;s family returned to counseling. The child&rsquo;s grandparents paid for it, at $120 per hour, believing in the beginning that it would set the family at ease and result in their grandchild acting like a boy.</p>
		<p>Even McKenzie, who grew up in Berkeley, Calif., in the 1960s and thought she was handling with grace the role of supportive mother to a son who painted glittery hearts and loved hair bows, did not accurately predict the outcome of the counseling. It still seemed to her it was possible that her child&rsquo;s insistence that she was a girl was the way she expressed her imagination.</p>
		<p>Elsa&rsquo;s parents tried to let her guide them, not reacting when at first she said she felt like a &ldquo;boy and a girl&rdquo; or later, when she said she was sure she was a girl. She chose her new name after watching Frozen and putting on a play in the living room with her brother and her best friend, Annie, a neighbor she has known since they were babies.</p>
		<p>It took her brother and best friend only a few days to call her Elsa and &ldquo;her&rdquo; consistently, because it seemed to fit. &ldquo;Annie was like, &lsquo;I know you were meant to be a girl,&rsquo; &rdquo; Elsa recalled recently, as the two girls sat with their backs against the side of Elsa&rsquo;s bed, hovering over a menu they were writing for a make-believe restaurant . &ldquo;Annie was totally on board. She understood me the whole time.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>A year ago, Elsa told her family it felt &ldquo;like paradise&rdquo; to hear them call her Elsa. Now she remembers the &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; rainbow and polka-dot swimsuits her mother bought her after she chose her new name.</p>
		<p>Elsa&rsquo;s father has struggled more than his wife to understand their child&rsquo;s gender identity. Until last year, he thought Elsa liked girlish things in part because of her close friendship with Annie. Now he says Elsa is &ldquo;genuine.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>On a recent summer day, Elsa was on the floor of the kids&rsquo; bedroom with Annie playing with a dollhouse and tiny animals who wear clothes. They wanted Elsa&rsquo;s brother, younger by one year, to leave them alone because Sky was getting the &ldquo;personalities&rdquo; of the animals all wrong. Sky was making the animal characters smack into things and jump off the roof, disrupting the thoughtful animal conversations the girls were imagining.</p>
		<p>Elsa was born on Valentine&rsquo;s Day to a young Denver couple and adopted soon after by Kai and Steve. A year later, the same couple called to ask Kai and Steve if they wanted to adopt the baby&rsquo;s younger sibling, whom Kai and Steve named Sky.</p>
		<p>Sky, who is 8, has followed Elsa&rsquo;s lead ever since. When Elsa wanted to dress up as princesses or pretend they were sisters, Sky joined. After gender identity counseling, the rambunctious Sky announced to the family, &ldquo;If she gets to choose, I do, too. And I haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>At school last spring, when Sky&rsquo;s music teacher asked the children to line up girls on one side, boys on the other, the first-grader blurted, &ldquo;What if I haven&rsquo;t decided yet?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The teacher immediately abandoned the lineup instructions.</p>
		<p>For this, the outgoing, fiery Sky is teased, while the nonconfrontational Elsa glides more easily through the school day. Elsa is gentle and shy, sensitive, with an inner strength that emerges when she is challenged. Sky is the crusader.</p>
		<p>Elsa started school last fall as a new student, and her classmates knew her only as Elsa. Even her teacher did not know she was a transgender child. The teasing got bad enough for Sky, though, that McKenzie pulled the kids out of school two weeks before the year ended in May.</p>
		<p>Most incidents started with this question, &ldquo;Are you a boy or a girl?&rdquo; This fall, they will start fresh at a new school, still in the Boulder Valley district.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Sky channels all this stuff for Elsa&rdquo; McKenzie said. &ldquo;Sky has soaked all of this in from the very beginning. Elsa just wants to survive.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>In the past year, gender identity has moved to the forefront of discussion in their house, so much so that McKenzie even refers to Sky&rsquo;s two-legged Lego monster stomping around the breakfast table as a &ldquo;they.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; their mother asks, then corrects, &ldquo;their name?&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">Elsa will turn 10 this winter, and puberty could change everything.</p>
		<p>The next step in her journey is an appointment with Colorado&rsquo;s leading pediatric endocrinologist for transgender youths who want to stop puberty. Elsa is scheduled to see Dr. Dan Reirden at The Children&rsquo;s Hospital next month.</p>
		<p>Reirden can prescribe hormone blockers that would prevent Elsa from developing a deeper voice, an Adam&rsquo;s apple and other masculine features that many transgender adults try to alter through painful, expensive surgeries that involve cutting into the voice box and breaking bones in the face.</p>
		<p>Blocking puberty with monthly hormone injections &mdash; which cost $2,200 and are covered by Medicaid in Colorado but only by some private insurance companies &mdash; is &ldquo;fully reversible, if someone changed their mind,&rdquo; Reirden said.</p>
		<p>Not one of Reirden&rsquo;s patients has reversed course. He has been blocking puberty in Colorado since 2007 and currently sees 120 transgender youths. After blocking puberty, patients receive hormone treatment to help them transform to the gender opposite the one they were assigned at birth.</p>
		<p>Recent studies have shown that about 15 percent to 30 percent of children ages 3 to 8 who express gender nonconformity go on to become transgender. But among adolescents still expressing transgender identity, <a href="./docs/apa-guidelines-transgender.pdf">a large majority remain so</a>.</p>
		<p>Ideally, Reirden first sees a gender nonconforming patient by age 8, at least to meet the child and create a plan of assessing when puberty will start. Puberty includes five stages, or sexual maturity ratings. The best time to start puberty blockers is in the second stage &mdash; the beginning of breast buds for girls or an increase of testicles to 4 milliliters for boys, Reirden said.</p>
		<p>Endocrinologists have been using puberty blockers for years with FDA approval in children who start puberty too early. Prescribing the drugs for transgender children is an &ldquo;off-label&rdquo; use, but doctors in the field of transgender care expect that to change.</p>
		<p>They also expect new international guidelines that would lower the recommended age, now 16, for prescribing hormones of the opposite gender. At the Child and Adolescent Gender Center at the University of California-San Francisco, children younger than 16 already are receiving estrogen or testosterone injections because doctors there believe that pausing puberty and withholding opposite-gender hormones for too many years could lead to bone mineral deficiency.</p>

		<p>No other ill effects of the treatments are known, but there is scant long-term data on transgender youths.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The problem in this entire field is there is a paucity of data,&rdquo; said Dr. Stephen M. Rosenthal, director of the UCSF-housed gender center.</p>
		<p>Elsa&rsquo;s family counselor has discussed puberty with her, explained how it would turn her into a man. The girl&rsquo;s parents have let her know some transgender women have surgery and some don&rsquo;t. Later, Elsa told her mother, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind growing into a man, as long as everyone knows I&rsquo;m a woman.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Whether she will ever get gender reassignment surgery is a question for the distant future, her parents said. The decision is personal. &ldquo;There is a very strong ethic in this community that you don&rsquo;t talk about people&rsquo;s body parts without their permission,&rdquo; McKenzie said.</p>
		<p>From here on, Elsa&rsquo;s parents are trying to let her express gender however she likes. McKenzie taught a transgender education class at their church and persuaded the nearby Boulder recreation center to label the restrooms for either gender.</p>
		<p>Looking back, she feels grief about the things she said to make Elsa act like a boy. The time she bought princess dolls because Elsa begged for them, then spent hours cutting and sewing to make them into boy dolls. Or the forced haircuts, which she finally stopped when Elsa told her, &ldquo;There is magic in hair.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>As Elsa&rsquo;s mother, she was her &ldquo;main emotional connection,&rdquo; her guide to sort out her feelings. &ldquo;I had been the one funneling that assignment, that doctrine that &lsquo;you have to be this.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s really painful,&rdquo; McKenzie said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the way you want to see yourself as a parent.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>McKenzie recalls a day when Elsa was 4 and wore a pale-blue Cinderella dress to Target. A passer-by commented, &ldquo;Oh, what a beautiful girl!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And Elsa beamed.</p>
		<p>Her smile faded, though, when her mother told her she was not &ldquo;being authentic.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But, her parents now believe, she always was.</p>
