		<p class="lead">Vicki Kluzek was about to shut off the lights for the night when her youngest child slid into the family-room chair beside her and spoke three words that would upend their lives.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a girl,&rdquo; said the 15-year-old.</p>
		<p>Vicki felt her stomach constrict, her insides twist. From her seat on the tan couch, she was looking into the eyes of her son, wondering what she had missed. But she saved the &ldquo;freaking out&rdquo; for behind the closed bedroom door with her husband, Erik.</p>
		<p>A night later, when their teenager repeated the words to Vicki and Erik as they watched television &mdash; not far from the Bibles and theology texts that line the family bookshelf &mdash; Erik felt as if a train had knocked the wind out of his body.</p>
		<p>They were parents who went to <a href="http://www.focusonthefamily.com/">Focus on the Family</a> seminars that taught fathers to bond with their sons so they wouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;turn out gay.&rdquo; They opposed gay marriage and thought transgender children were under the influence of ultra-liberal parents who brainwashed them. Vicki once called her oldest daughter&rsquo;s school and blocked a French teacher&rsquo;s plans to show &ldquo;<a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/mavieenrose/">Ma Vie en Rose</a>,&rdquo; a film about a transgender child.</p>
		<p>Erik is a conservative Lutheran, and Vicki is a Mormon who not only shuns coffee and alcohol, both forbidden by the <a href="https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng">Latter-day Saints</a>, but believed gay and trans people were choosing to commit sin. When Erik&rsquo;s new job brought them from Utah to Boulder County years ago in the middle of an LGBT film festival, she was &ldquo;scandalized&rdquo; and asked, &ldquo;Oh my heavens, where have I moved?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Now their teenager, raised in the Mormon church, stood in the family room and said, &ldquo;For my birthday, I want hormone treatments.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Just weeks earlier, they were watching television news about a <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_23529796/coy-mathis-family-celebrates-civil-rights-win-transgender">transgender girl fighting to use the bathrooms</a> at her Colorado Springs-area elementary school. They wondered what was wrong with the girl&rsquo;s parents, why they were letting their child&rsquo;s &ldquo;imagination&rdquo; cause so much drama. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re letting this fantasy go on too long,&rdquo; Vicki remarked.</p>

For Vicki, after hours of prayer, acceptance came in her dreams. She started dreaming of her youngest child as a girl. &ldquo;That, to me, felt like an answer,&rdquo; she said.</p>

		<p>No one remembers whether the word &ldquo;transgender&rdquo; was spoken that night in the family room two years ago. The whole conversation felt abstract. It &ldquo;scared the hell&rdquo; out of Erik, a reserved and patient software engineer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research with a black belt in taekwondo.</p>
		<p>Vicki managed to squeak out, &ldquo;We will love you no matter what.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="lead">They were astonished. This was a child who loved video games, played Dungeons and Dragons, took taekwondo classes, grew up in Boy Scouts and made the family laugh by saying in a low voice, recently deepened by puberty, &ldquo;This is CNN.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>When Erik and Vicki dug through their memories, though, they found a few things.</p>
		<p>When their youngest was in first grade, long before her name was Alison and before she asked her parents to use &ldquo;she&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo; pronouns, the child removed the pink markers from new school supplies every year and told Vicki, &ldquo;Pink is for girls, and I&rsquo;m not a girl.&rdquo; Vicki recalls thinking, &ldquo;Was there ever any question?&rdquo; As she got older, she never used a urinal.</p>

		<p>There were signs of depression too, misunderstood back then. A grade-school teacher asked Erik and Vicki what was going on at home that would cause their child to draw so many pictures of sad faces and bleeding people and grown-ups shouting &ldquo;No!&rdquo; They had no clue. Erik and Vicki did not allow violent television shows or computer games. They barely even raise their voices.</p>
		<p>In middle school, she became obsessed with the &ldquo;My Little Pony&rdquo; show, but there are plenty of boys &mdash; called &ldquo;bronies&rdquo; &mdash; who watch the reboot of the animated show from the 1980s, a defined counter-culture movement.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Looking back is the only way we can see anything,&rdquo; Erik said.</p>
		<p>For Alison, though, the feelings were always there. She pushed them down each time they bubbled up, denying them to the point her whole life felt numb, like a &ldquo;hibernation.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Until she no longer could.</p>
		<p>Until she felt she would rather die than go on as a boy. &ldquo;It eventually got to the point where there was just so much evidence and I had figured myself out to the point where I had to give in,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t, it would have destroyed me.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>There weren&rsquo;t a lot of words the night Alison asked her parents for female hormones. She had spent months researching online, googling &ldquo;hormone replacement therapy&rdquo; and even choosing a doctor as she tried to untangle her own feelings in solitude. She spent hours talking online with trans teens. And months later, when she chose the name Alison, it was in part because six letters is the ideal length for an Internet log-in.</p>
		<p>Vicki and Erik, though, were forced to digest what Alison was saying after it smacked them in the face seemingly out of nowhere on a June night. Afterward, their child, still presenting as male, went upstairs for what felt like the rest of the summer.</p>
		<p>Erik and Vicki turned to religious counseling. Erik was embarrassed, self-conscious and worried having a transgender child would reflect poorly on his church, where he was on the board of elders.</p>
		<p>At first, they convinced themselves it was &ldquo;just a phase.&rdquo; They coaxed gently, &ldquo;Just be happy with who you are.&rdquo; They found Alison a therapist &mdash; not a reparative therapist who would try to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; her, because they knew she wouldn&rsquo;t go. But they admit they hoped that counseling would stamp out her desire to get female hormones. Their initial response to hormones was unequivocal: no way.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We were like, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not going to happen, but we will get you a therapist,&rsquo; &rdquo; Vicki said. &ldquo;At first I thought she was making a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Alison, meanwhile, became a recluse.</p>

		<p>It was the summer of long, solitary walks, of curling up in a ball, crying into her pillow. &ldquo;I spent a lot of time in my room, waiting for things to change,&rdquo; Alison said. &ldquo;There was quite a lot of pain. The pain was unbearable, and I just wanted it to end. I saw two endings to this.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>In one of them, she did not survive.</p>
		<p class="lead">It came down to this question, ringing in Erik&rsquo;s head: &ldquo;Do you want a dead son who committed suicide, or do you want a new daughter?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Toward the end of summer 2013, she asked them to call her Alison and use feminine pronouns. Erik and Vicki were &ldquo;lousy at it,&rdquo; though, and Alison&rsquo;s older brother, Kevin, was avoiding her. &ldquo;It was so weird and I didn&rsquo;t know how to talk about it,&rdquo; said Kevin, now 23. &ldquo;I sort of shut down. I felt super awkward. I felt terrible.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Kevin, who isn&rsquo;t the type for confrontation or prying conversation, told his friends just as they were walking through the front door of the family&rsquo;s house that his brother was now his sister. He allowed no time for questions. On purpose.</p>
		<p>Alison spent the whole summer in a fog, so much so that she remembers little of it. She started to wear female clothes, at first only when she was alone in her room. Her therapist sat her parents down and explained that each time they used the wrong name or pronouns, it crushed her.</p>
		<p>The thought of returning to school in the fall brought on waves of stomach-seizing anxiety. She wasn&rsquo;t ready to show up as Alison and deal with the whispers and stares, yet the thought of going backward, of faking it any longer as a boy, was even more unbearable.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like being in a car accident and having a steal beam thrust through your chest and then nobody taking that seriously and everyone just telling you to get over it,&rdquo; she said, her voice wavering and two tears slipping down her cheek. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not the momentary pain that&rsquo;s the worst. It&rsquo;s the fact that it&rsquo;s going on constantly and it doesn&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The night before Alison was supposed to start her sophomore year of high school, she emerged from her room and handed her parents a handwritten note.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I feel like killing myself,&rdquo; it said.</p>
		<p>The family spent the night in an emergency room, where the staff pointed out to Vicki and Erik that they were alternating between calling her Alison and her birth name. They refer to it as the &ldquo;worst night of their lives.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>They learned that <a href="http://transpulseproject.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Impacts-of-Strong-Parental-Support-for-Trans-Youth-vFINAL.pdf">57 percent of trans youth without parental support try to kill themselves</a>, compared with 4 percent who have strong parental support. Erik and Vicki didn&rsquo;t make Alison return to high school the next day, or that year, signing her up for online courses instead.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t functional anyway. It was ridiculous that we thought she could go to school,&rdquo; Erik said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We realized this was a matter of life or death for Alison,&rdquo; Vicki said. &ldquo;She was either going to live as Alison or she wasn&rsquo;t going to make it. I had this fear that I was going to lose her before I even knew who she was.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Erik&rsquo;s pastor, who decades ago had counseled gay men with HIV who were rejected by their families, advised him to love and support her. Pastor John Thieme of Christ our Savior Lutheran in Longmont said people often make moral judgements in black and white until something personal &ldquo;shatters their world view.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Thieme said he couldn&rsquo;t answer Erik&rsquo;s question about whether being transgender is a sin, but he is certain &ldquo;we are all broken in various ways.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;My job is not to say your brokenness is worse than mine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are all sinners. We all need God&rsquo;s grace.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>With Thieme&rsquo;s help, Erik &ldquo;decided that the Christian approach was to love our daughter unconditionally, even though I didn&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>By October, four months after the bombshell in the family room, Vicki and Erik took Alison to a Denver doctor to find out about hormone treatment options, the ones she had asked for as a 16th birthday present. For Alison, waiting those four months was excruciating, like she was stuck in a time warp, hating everything about herself that was male.</p>
		<p>During the appointment, Dr. Anna Wegleitner explained that hormones would make Alison grow breasts, redistribute fat to give her a feminine shape, and make her skin smoother. But testosterone blockers, which are taken in conjunction with estrogen, could make her sterile.</p>
		<p>Vicki and Erik suggested going to a sperm bank, in case Alison someday wanted biological children. &ldquo;It was a disaster,&rdquo; Erik recalled. Alison was anguished: &ldquo;You are trying to make me preserve the male part of me that I hate,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>For Erik, that was a turning point. &ldquo;It made me realize where she was at,&rdquo; he said.</p>
		<p>For Vicki, after hours of prayer, acceptance came in her dreams. She started dreaming of her youngest child as a girl. &ldquo;That, to me, felt like an answer,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>At Alison&rsquo;s request, they took down the taekwondo certificates in her old name and the school and vacation photographs that filled the walls of their home, save one: a baby surrounded by mounds of stuffed animals, her smiling face and bare toes poking out of the pile.</p>
		<p>The rest are too painful for her to see.</p>

		<p class="lead">It was a crisis of faith that left Alison open to feel and to discover her identity.</p>
		<p>Half a year before she considered that she was transgender, Alison began questioning her belief in the Mormon Church. Her research on the Latter-day Saints was sparked by her older brother, Kevin, who showed her a video he found on Reddit of a temple ceremony where Mormons in ceremonial gowns taught each other handshakes needed to enter heaven. She realized she no longer believed in the same God.</p>
		<p>That discovery, at 15 years old, rocked her world.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;When the foundation of how you think the world works is destroyed, the entire building collapses,&rdquo; Alison said. &ldquo;You have to put things back together in a way that they won&rsquo;t topple again. You have to figure out who you are and what works and what is right. When that happened, I found a lot of pieces that didn&rsquo;t fit.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The intense self-reflection, although challenging, energized her.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I started being passionate. I started talking more. I no longer just sat in my head all the time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There was so much that was just buried, and I brought it all up, for good and for bad.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Her brother noticed too. &ldquo;She went from being this person who was very quiet and disconnected to all of a sudden a person who was passionate about a lot of things,&rdquo; Kevin said.</p>
		<p>Because of their mother&rsquo;s chronic pain issues, the family was not regularly attending LDS services. Instead, church leaders came to their house to give Vicki, who uses an oxygen tank, the sacrament. Erik hardly misses a Sunday at Christ our Savior Lutheran.</p>
		<p>Alison now says that &ldquo;being trans and being in the church is like being in an abusive relationship.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The Mormon church will not baptize transgender people who are planning to have gender-reassignment surgery and will not allow trans people to become priests or receive recommendations to participate in temple ceremonies. Church leaders counsel members against surgeries, and members who want to socially transition but not have surgery are dealt with on a &ldquo;case-by-case basis,&rdquo; said Salt Lake City-based church spokesman Eric Hawkins.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We believe that gender is part of our eternal God-given identity and purpose,&rdquo; he said.</p>

		<p>According to Mormon faith, every person&rsquo;s spirit has a gender, one that existed before birth and will transcend after death. God does not make mistakes by mismatching spirit and body. Vicki, who grew up in the tiny, predominately Mormon town of Star Valley, Wyo., believes Alison has a female spirit and will be a girl in heaven.</p>
		<p>LDS doctrine says transitioning to another gender is a &ldquo;transgression&rdquo; that might require official action regarding membership.</p>
		<p>Vicki is unsure whether transitioning to another gender is a sin, but she is firm in her belief that God wants her to love her daughter. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t change how I feel about her,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I came to the realization that Alison&rsquo;s life doesn&rsquo;t affect my relationship with God. She can be who she is, and I can be who I am. It&rsquo;s not a conflict with my faith to love my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Alison wonders if God made trans people to test others, or maybe to &ldquo;make genders a little less divided.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Erik and Vicki, trying to gently break the news to Vicki&rsquo;s Mormon side of the family, wrote a long e-mail announcing his daughter&rsquo;s new name and quoting LDS doctrine, which calls for cherishing the family unit. &ldquo;Think of the platinum rule &mdash; do unto others as they would have you do unto them,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Please continue to cherish and support her just as you did before.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Only one person responded.</p>
		<p>Erik and Vicki later decided not to attend an out-of-state family reunion after relatives requested that no one speak about Alison&rsquo;s transition because it might influence her younger cousins. Alison&rsquo;s grandmother remarks that Alison&rsquo;s head was filled with ideas she &ldquo;found on the Internet.&rdquo; And Alison&rsquo;s older sister, who lives out of state, told her that transitioning was against God.</p>
		<p>In Erik and Vicki&rsquo;s living room, scattered with dog toys for their rambunctious Yorkie, Ruby, there is a framed plaque with pink tulips. &ldquo;Be kind,&rdquo; it says. &ldquo;Everyone is fighting a difficult battle.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">Almost two years after that initial conversation with his daughter, Erik posted something like a much-belated baby announcement on Facebook last spring.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We now have to retract that we had a boy 17 years ago and very proudly announce that we have a 17-year-old girl named Alison. So welcome to the world our Alison!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Alison, now 18, attends a Boulder Valley high school where acceptance and anti-bullying are infused in the curriculum. She&rsquo;s no longer &ldquo;failing every other class,&rdquo; and she spends less time playing video games with Kevin because she no longer needs the mind-numbing escape.</p>
		<p>She grew her straight, brown hair long and buys her clothes mostly from Amazon because she&rsquo;s too shy to shop for them in person. She wears one of her favorite tops &mdash; a teal, Indian-inspired blouse with velvet cuffs &mdash; with loose-fitting jeans and her black sneakers. But in public, she sometimes hides under a hooded sweatshirt. She marvels how, because of the female hormones, her skin is sensitive enough that she had to place a blanket over a scratchy chair in her room that never bothered her before.</p>

		<p>Alison spends far less time alone. On family film nights, she critiques movies to the point of her family&rsquo;s annoyance, and she laughs. She philosophizes about religion, debates God&rsquo;s existence with her family, and says her only obligation is to &ldquo;good.&rdquo; She figures society won&rsquo;t accept trans people until a &ldquo;critical mass&rdquo; of the population knows someone who is trans.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Before, I was a little bit like an iceberg where there was only 1 percent of me visible, maybe 10 percent at most,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m passionate about things. I could have never talked like this before. I barely talked at all.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Alison said her relationship with her parents is more genuine than it was two years ago, although she trusted even then that they wouldn&rsquo;t kick her out or send her to a &ldquo;conversion camp.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Erik and Vicki have become trans advocates, at their churches and beyond. Erik testified this year at the state Capitol in favor of a bill that would have made it easier for trans people to change the gender on their birth certificates. He is on the advisory board for <a href="http://www.tyes-colorado.org/index.html">Trans-Youth Education &amp; Support</a>, based in Boulder County, volunteers for <a href="http://pflagboulder.org/">PFLAG Boulder</a>, and wrote a six-page letter to the theology headquarters of the Lutheran Church urging it to eliminate inflammatory words such as &ldquo;mutilate God&rsquo;s body&rdquo; from its gender-identity guidelines. He wishes he could apologize to the gay community for &ldquo;being a jerk.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Kevin, who used to think transgender people came from &ldquo;other&rdquo; families until it &ldquo;slapped&rdquo; him in the face, is Alison&rsquo;s best friend.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I have all these memories of times with my little brother, and the relationship we had,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, I have a sister. Sometimes I miss that, but she is so much better of a person, in every conceivable way.&rdquo;</p>
