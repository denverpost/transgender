		<p class="lead">Her voice.</p>
		<p style="clear:left;">She hates the sound of it, low and deep, like a man&rsquo;s. It keeps Staff Sgt. Patricia King up at night. Especially when the next dawn means she will have to lead soldiers on a 4-mile training run, when she will have to &ldquo;call cadence&rdquo; while jogging in formation.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;ve been told,&rdquo; she will shout, rhyming amid ragged breaths before the sun lightens the Army&rsquo;s Fort Carson, south of Colorado Springs. But it will come out like a man&rsquo;s voice because she can&rsquo;t control its pitch while shouting and running in the thin air at the base of the Rockies.</p>
		<p>The night before these monthly runs, she is restless. Trish, an openly transgender female soldier, lies awake, hoping someday she will make the $10,000-trip to Seoul, South Korea, the world&rsquo;s hub for vocal feminization surgery, where doctors can laser her vocal chords. It is the surgery she wants most.</p>
		<p>Trish, who for 16 years lived as a male soldier, wants the Army to recognize her as female, to acknowledge the gender identity she disclosed this year and allow her to adhere to female dress code and bunking standards. The Army considers her male, even though she began taking female hormones in March and changed her name to Patricia.</p>
		<p>Transgender people are banned from the military, <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Transgender-Military-Service-May-2014.pdf">yet an estimated 15,500 are serving</a>. An increasing number have revealed themselves in recent years, their treatment fluctuating wildly depending on their location and supervisors. The Department of Defense is reviewing the ban, with a decision expected next May.</p>
		<p>For now, Trish must play the role of male soldier while on duty. It is only after work, at her home in Colorado Springs, that she lives &ldquo;genuinely.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Splitting her life in two is a torment.</p>

		<p>On this September morning &ldquo;payday&rdquo; run, a fellow soldier spots the bobby pins holding up Trish&rsquo;s hair and informs her supervisor. Army dress code prohibits men from wearing hair accessories.</p>
		<p>Afterward, when Trish is back home to shower and put on her male service uniform &mdash; a formal suit with pockets over the breast that no longer lie flat because of Trish&rsquo;s changing figure &mdash; her supervisor texts to say they need to talk about the bobby pins.</p>
		<p>The bobby pins.</p>
		<p>Trish turns off Taylor Swift on her living room stereo as she calls her boss, blinking fast to fight off the tears. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen again,&rdquo; she says, voice quivering.</p>
		<p>Trish, 35, isn&rsquo;t trying to hide anything. The first person she told this year that she intended to transition to a woman &mdash; after her parents and her two elementary-school-age sons &mdash; was her military doctor. The second was her supervisor, because she was determined to come out in a &ldquo;professional way&rdquo; and &ldquo;not because somebody caught me at Walmart dressed genuinely.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>She began taking female hormones in March, prescribed by a nonmilitary doctor because her military physician could not dispense transgender health care under current military regulations.</p>
		<p>Trish&rsquo;s colleagues call her Sgt. King, not using her old first name &mdash; her &ldquo;dead name&rdquo; that she prefers never to hear &mdash; or the one she chose for herself. But many co-workers have adjusted to using &ldquo;she&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo; pronouns at her request. Still, Trish must adhere to male dress code at the headquarters of the 4th Infantry and is required to use the men&rsquo;s bathroom, a fact that causes her to &ldquo;drink less water.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Women are not allowed to serve in the infantry, a combat unit, further complicating Trish&rsquo;s career. The defense department also is reviewing this policy. &ldquo;Where I work, there are only men, and me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>Trish &mdash; who has done three tours in Afghanistan and has jumped armed with machine guns out of planes and helicopters &mdash; returns home from work and yanks off her combat boots. She slips into a skirt and pops in beaded, dangling earrings.</p>

		<p class="lead">Transgender people <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Transgender-Military-Service-May-2014.pdf">are twice as likely to join the military</a> in this country &mdash; estimated at 21 percent, compared with 11 percent of all adults, according to a UCLA study.</p>
		<p>Beyond the typical draws of patriotism and career opportunities, there are other reasons, sometimes buried so deep that trans service members don&rsquo;t recognize them for years.</p>
		<p>Trish, like many other trans women, was hoping to &ldquo;man up&rdquo; by immersing herself in the hypermasculine culture of the service, even though she didn&rsquo;t realize that when she enlisted after high school. It&rsquo;s a place to hide from self-reflection, to &ldquo;become a real man.&rdquo; For trans men, it&rsquo;s a place to become &ldquo;one of the guys.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Another reason for the overrepresentation is that trans people have a harder time finding jobs in the private sector, said Aaron Belkin, founder of the Palm Center, a research institute that studies the military&rsquo;s transgender policy after spending a decade working on gay and lesbian service until &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; was repealed by Congress five years ago. Unlike &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; the transgender ban is not a law but a military policy that the Defense Department has the power to reverse.</p>

		<p>The institute reviewed 14 military rules &mdash; from grooming standards to physical requirements to showers &mdash; to make recommendations on policy changes if the transgender ban is lifted. For the most part, the recommendations were simple: Hold men, including trans men, to male standards and hold women, including trans women, to female standards.</p>
		<p>As for showers and bathrooms, men and women in combat have shared the same quarters for years. And regarding health insurance for active service members and veterans, <a href="http://www.palmcenter.org/publications/recent">the Palm Center</a> argues it should cover transgender care &mdash; including hormones and surgeries &mdash; whenever deemed medically necessary.</p>
		<p>Banning trans troops for medical reasons is outdated and not medically sound, said Dr. Alan Steinman, a retired rear admiral and former director of health and safety for the Coast Guard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all kind of silly,&rdquo; said Steinman, who co-wrote <a href="http://www.palmcenter.org/files/Transgender%20Military%20Service%20Report_0.pdf">a report for the Palm Center</a>. &ldquo;It really isn&rsquo;t justified.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Military policy, for example, says it&rsquo;s too complicated for trans service members in combat to receive hormone treatment. Yet troops receive hormones overseas for a multitude of other reasons, among the most basic of which is birth control. Also, while the latest issue of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders no longer classifies gender nonconformity as a mental illness, military regulations still treat it as a psychological problem.</p>
		<p>Signs point to an end to the ban next year. Authority to enforce it has crept higher up the chain of command. In July, the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/612778">Defense Department announced</a> that Undersecretary Brad Carson would have to give &ldquo;personal approval&rdquo; to discharge a transgender person or bar them from enlisting based on gender identity. And a working group starting from the presumption that trans people can &ldquo;serve openly without adverse impact&rdquo; began meeting in August.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SPARTAArmedForces">SPARTA</a>, a national advocacy and support group for LGBT service members founded in 2013, counts more than 300 trans people among its 2,000 members. Near Fort Carson, five transgender soldiers, including Trish, attend a local support group.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want a new standard, just to be held to the standard of our gender,&rdquo; Trish said. &ldquo;Transgender people have always served. Our presence is nothing new.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>With the policy change, she said, trans service members &ldquo;will be able to be as proud of themselves as they are of their service to this country.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="lead">The white Riesling splashes into Trish&rsquo;s glass, an extra-large pour. Tonight, she has a bottle sitting next to her computer, instead of the usual box of moscato she calls a &ldquo;big-girl sippy cup.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She crosses her legs and types with manicured nails in her home office, gold studs shining on her earlobes. She&rsquo;s wearing capris, showing off her pink cherry-blossom tattoo.</p>
		<p>On the walls, military awards given in her former name share space with photographs of a camouflaged Trish with a buzz cut in Afghanistan. From across the country, other transgender service members pop up on Trish&rsquo;s computer screen with a ping, joining the weekly Google chat that Trish created and fondly calls &ldquo;Wine Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>There is Cpl. Laila Villanueva in Honolulu, surreal palm trees and fluffy clouds out her window as she cruises down a highway, brown hair flying. Senior Airman Logan Ireland is stationed at Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma, giant biceps stretching his gray T-shirt as he drinks a blueberry protein smoothie straight from a blender. In Bethesda, Md., Army Maj. Jamie Henry, a physician at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, is sitting at her laptop at a cafe after finishing rounds.</p>
		<p>The conversation starts with small talk &mdash; the tofu stockpiled in Ireland&rsquo;s refrigerator and the excessive amounts of military-issue gear they have to lug around the country with every move. &ldquo;You can shoot exactly zero guns with cold-weather mittens on,&rdquo; says Trish, who keeps a handgun in her purse. &ldquo;They would make better slippers.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>But talk shifts quickly to news earlier in the week that the Pentagon isn&rsquo;t expected to let trans people serve openly until next spring. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just leave things in limbo for three seasons,&rdquo; Trish says. &ldquo;There are people, human beings, that are dealing with this issue.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Even among the small group at Wine Wednesday, the military&rsquo;s inconsistencies are rampant.</p>
		<p>Ireland, who transitioned in 2012 after joining two years earlier, is the only trans person known to the group to receive an official &ldquo;exception of policy&rdquo; allowing him to adhere to male standards even though, according to the Air Force, he is female. While deployed to Afghanistan last spring, he bunked with men who had no idea he is transgender. At pre-deployment training, Ireland said he &ldquo;went to the highest-ranking person and said, &lsquo;I was born female. Where would you like me to bunk?&rsquo; &rdquo; The answer was swift: &ldquo;You look male. You are male. We will put you with the males,&rdquo; he recalled.</p>
		<p>But Villanueva, who wore a scooped-neck blouse and earrings during the Google chat, has been stopped by superiors who criticized her for pushing boundaries off duty with her attire and styled hair. At first, most colleagues used female pronouns and made little mention of her figure and smoother skin, but when she chose the uber-feminine name Laila two years ago, the harassment began.</p>
		<p>Villanueva, a combat medic, is engaged to Ireland, whom she met through the LGBT military support group.</p>
		<p>She believes her struggle to gain acceptance within her unit, compared with Ireland&rsquo;s relative ease, illustrates a higher level of tolerance in the military &mdash; and society in general &mdash; for female-to-male transition compared with male-to-female. In other words, a tomboy is more tolerable than a masculine person in a skirt.</p>

		<p>In the U.S., about twice as many people identify as trans women compared with trans men, according to <a href="http://www.census.gov/srd/carra/15_03_Likely_Transgender_Individuals_in_ARs_and_2010Census.pdf">Social Security Administration data</a> and <a href="http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf">a transgender discrimination survey</a>. One theory is that women have more flexibility to dress and live as masculine and so aren&rsquo;t as compelled to transition to male.</p>
		<p>When Villanueva and Ireland were invited to an LGBT military reception at the White House last summer and posed for a picture with President Barack Obama, Ireland was allowed to wear his male &ldquo;dress blues&rdquo; while Villanueva showed up in a dress. If she had not worn civilian clothes, she would have had to wear a male uniform.</p>
		<p>Henry, a physician in the Army Medical Corps and the first active-duty Army officer to come out as trans, believes she is the only trans service member whose superiors approved the paperwork to change genders in the military computer system. Yet she must adhere to male dress standards at the hospital.</p>
		<p>Henry decided to become an Army doctor in part because she hoped it could &ldquo;cure&rdquo; her gender dysphoria. Ireland, 27, knew who he was when he joined the Air Force, but he was denying it.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We want to fit into those gender roles that we were born into,&rdquo; Ireland said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s us trying to hide something and live a double life.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Now, though, with the defense department signaling it will lift the ban, out trans service members are urging others to join them. &ldquo;There comes a point in our lives where we are just done pretending,&rdquo; Villanueva said.</p>

		<p><h3 class="subheading">&ldquo;I choose to love my child&rdquo;</h3></p>

		<p class="lead">Ronnie King was sitting in a bank parking lot Jan. 3 when she read an e-mail from Trish that terrified her. Her daughter warned at the start, &ldquo;This is probably a sit-down-and-have-some-tissues-handy e-mail.&rdquo; And then, &ldquo;Nobody is dead, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The next few words left Ronnie stupefied.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I am and always have been transgender. This simply means that I identify as or wish that I was female. I have prayed about this. I have ignored it, tried to hide from it, and hoped it would go away. Only recently have I accepted that this is part of who I am.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Ronnie barely understood the e-mail. &ldquo;This was pre-Caitlyn Jenner,&rdquo; she explains, and Ronnie only knew of one trans person, a woman who worked with her at the soup company. She sent Trish a text that said &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; but she didn&rsquo;t want to talk to her yet.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I prayed a lot and begged God to take this away. I didn&rsquo;t understand, and I didn&rsquo;t want to lose my son. For a parent who had a child for 34½ years that was one person and is now a different person ... there was a period of mourning.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>About six weeks later, Ronnie, a human resources director in Massachusetts, came across a job application in which a woman explained that she had left her previous job because she lost her child in Iraq. Ronnie felt like God was trying to get her attention. &ldquo;Oh, man, I have my child,&rdquo; she said.</p>
		<p>Trish&rsquo;s dad, who adopted her when she was 8, came home from work one day last March and said, &ldquo;I choose to love my child.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Trish&rsquo;s sons still call her daddy but use &ldquo;she&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo; pronouns. It&rsquo;s awkward in public, but she&rsquo;s not ready to ask them to stop.</p>
		<p>The boys, who are 9 and 7 and live with their mom after a 2014 divorce, seemed to digest their dad&rsquo;s news more easily than most adults. Trish asked them to close their eyes and describe themselves. The oldest said he was good at Legos, and the youngest said he was a &ldquo;very funny&rdquo; person. And then Trish asked, &ldquo;Do you think boy or girl when you describe yourself?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I told them, &lsquo;When I close my eyes and see myself, I see a girl,&rsquo; &rdquo; Trish said. &ldquo;I told them I was going to be the person I am supposed to be, that this is a secret that I&rsquo;ve kept for a really long time.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Trish recalled that the children seemed sad that their daddy had lived so long with that kind of secret. They didn&rsquo;t ask many questions.</p>

		<p>Her interest in the military was sparked in part by a disabled Vietnam veteran whom Trish visited weekly to play checkers and watch movies. Trish&rsquo;s mother falters and says &ldquo;our child,&rdquo; instead of her only child&rsquo;s given name, Peter, when she talks about the time Trish bought an iguana without telling her parents, then persuaded her friends to feed it while her family went on a weeklong summer vacation in Maine. Her parents found the lizard, Gus, upon returning home to the stench.</p>
		<p>Instead of taking down her old photographs &mdash; the ones that show a little boy, then a grown son with children &mdash; Ronnie is adding new ones of Trish. She looks different, she said, but &ldquo;the heart and soul is all the same.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;One of the things that I&rsquo;m very thankful for is that Trish is not walking away from the past,&rdquo; Ronnie said. &ldquo;The past is who she is.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Trish was 12 years old watching TV when she first believed she was meant to be a girl. It was the iconic episode where Punky Brewster gets boobs, and Trish wished she could become Punky Brewster, and more specifically, a girl just like Punky Brewster.</p>
		<p>Two decades later, when Trish decided to &ldquo;live genuinely,&rdquo; she intended at first to do so without causing a ruckus within the Army. But that&rsquo;s not her. She soon felt a duty to speak up, to push back against military policies that refuse to recognize her gender identity or allow her to use the women&rsquo;s bathroom. She revealed herself to her boss even though it could have meant dismissal, and then filed requests &mdash; so far ignored &mdash; to change her gender marker and adhere to female dress code.</p>
		<p>She calls it a different kind of combat. &ldquo;Something was wrong and I felt I could help make it right,&rdquo; she said. Trish took the biblical name Esther as her middle name because her mother believes &ldquo;she was born for such a time as this.&rdquo; Supportive colleagues have told her it&rsquo;s not important how she looks, only that she is good at her job.</p>
		<p>Despite feeling embattled the past 10 months, Trish is relieved. She would rather face the stares from fellow soldiers the first time she showed up in women&rsquo;s clothes at a cookout, and the awkward conversation to warn them she would wear a bikini to the group rafting trip, than go back to a disingenuous life. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still easier to change the whole outside than the inside,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried.&rdquo;</p>
